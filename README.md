# What are ABAP Koans?

Essentially a Koan is a problem to solve.

Or from the Wikipedia article I think the most relevant explanation is:

> Insight has to be demonstrated. A mere "answer" to a koan is not sufficient. The teacher is not looking for a specific answer, but for evidence that the disciple has grasped the state of mind expressed by the koan itself.
> I think this is particularly relevant to the field of programming.
> For this I am borrowing from the idea of the original Ruby Koans which involves the practitioner fixing a number of broken unit tests. Using a unit test framework allows for rapid feedback of the topics being discussed and using an IDE we can easily insert breakpoints to explore the code at run-time.
